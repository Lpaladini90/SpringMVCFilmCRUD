#### Spring MVC Film CRUD



### Description Overview
This application allows a user to add, search, edit, and delete films from a SQL database. The home page offers various options for the user to select from, these options are: "Search film by id", "Search film by keyword", and "Add a film". The search film by keyword looks for films that contain the keyword entered in either the title or the description of the film. The keyword search returns a list of films that match the keyword entered, from witch you can select each film to view its full details. If no films were found for the search the user is informed.

The Id search returns all the details of a film that match the user search. If no film was found under that Id, the user is informed. When viewing a single films full details there are options to delete the film or edit the film. If edit is chosen, a new form is displayed from witch all the films information can be edited. When delete is chosen the user is displayed with if the delete was successful or failed.

          - Things I learned on this project was communication. Talking to the team and deciding what part of the project we should work on to avoid overwriting each others code. Using git pull/push can lead to accidental merge conflict mistakes. Linking controllers, DAO, and jsps was a challenge in making the app work. Using the web dev tools and doing sysout to debug and learning to read error messages was useful in completing this project. Overall really enjoyed working with a team.
