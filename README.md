#### Spring MVC Film CRUD



### Description Overview
This application allows a user to add, search, edit, and delete films from a SQL database. The home page offers various options for the user to select from, these options are: "Search film by id", "Search film by keyword", and "Add a film". The search film by keyword looks for films that contain the keyword entered in either the title or the description of the film. The keyword search returns a list of films that match the keyword entered, from witch you can select each film to view its full details. If no films were found for the search the user is informed.

The Id search returns all the details of a film that match the user search. If no film was found under that Id, the user is informed. When viewing a single films full details there are options to delete the film or edit the film. If edit is chosen, a new form is displayed from witch all the films information can be edited. When delete is chosen the user is displayed with if the delete was successful or failed.

          - This project really clarified controllers for me. Before this project I was quite lost on how to even set up a controller but now the setup and use it much clearer. Controllers allow you to pull information from forms by request mapping to form actions, and allow injection of information into your JSP adding objects to the model and view and referring to those objects in the JSP. We ran into some issues with getting the controllers to properly pull the information that we needed, but this was cleared up once we realized the relationship with input names and parameter values in the request mapping. This was also a first time with working on a team all working off the same git repo. This really shined a light on using git to collaborate with others and the workflow of having multiple people working on various parts of an application. We ran into a couple issues of editing the same code at first, but once we had a couple of hiccups we all had really good communication on what we planned to work on and avoided any overwrites.
